# Hi üëã I am Xiyi Lin

## üë©‚Äçüíª Self Intro
Hello! I'm a Data Scientist with a strong background in machine learning, statistical modeling, and data analytics. I have my MS degeree in Machine Learning and Data Science at Northwestern University. My passion lies in uncovering insights from complex datasets to drive business decisions and innovation. I have great experience working with diverse data sources, including real-time data platforms like Google Cloud and AWS, and have implemented solutions that optimize data retrieval, enhance predictive models, and streamline workflows, etc.

I believe that "good data serves for good purposes with right method". I've utilized tools like Python, R, SQL, and cloud platforms to deliver impactful results, and also aim for always optimzing the solution. My work spans from improving chatbot NLP capabilities using open-source models to predicting customer behavior with machine learning models. I am constantly learning and contributing to projects involving data-driven decision-making, automation, and scalability.

## üìà Project Highlights
- **[Beep](https://ridebeep.com): NLP and LLM for Multi-Passenger Autonomy**: This is the capstone project partnered with Beep which involved leveraging Google Cloud Platform and Postgres to store and retrieve real-time vehicle (GTFS) and location data, improving data retrieval speed by 40% and achieving 95% accuracy in providing timely route and safety information to passengers. Additionally, the chatbot's NLP capabilities were enhanced by 30% through the use of open-source LLMs via APIs, enabling faster and more efficient query processing. The implementation of zero-shot learning about NLP and function calling to categorize passenger queries further improved operational efficiency and provided real-time assistance, enhancing the overall satisfying passenger experience.
- **[Job Postings Text Summarization](https://github.com/xiyi1201/Job-Postings-Text-Summarization)**: This project aims to analyze and summarize LinkedIn data science job postings to uncover trends in required skills, software proficiencies, and job descriptions. The goal is to provide a concise and comprehensive understanding of employer expectations to help job seekers better align their profiles with industry demands.
- **[Time Series Forecasting: Patient Volume Prediction System](https://github.com/xiyi1201/Time-Series-Forecasting-Patient-Volume-Prediction-System)**: This project involved developing a time-series forecasting model to predict patient volume in a hospital unit, enabling hospital management to make informed resource allocation decisions. The system predicts patient volume 4 hours in advance for three daily shifts (7:00 AM, 3:00 PM, and 11:00 PM) using ARIMA, SARIMA, and LSTM models. Model training was performed on varying timeframes (6 months, 1 year, 18 months, and 2 years) and evaluated using the Mean Absolute Deviation (MAD) metric. The forecasts can be potentially used to help optimize staffing and improve patient care by accurately anticipating demand. 
- **[LCF-Donors Analysis and Classification](https://github.com/xiyi1201/LCF-Donors-Analysis-and-Classification)**: This is the practicum partnered with Little City Foundation which is about a comprehensive analysis of its donor file with an output of a responsive major & mid-level donor prospecting model to elevate and grow the top tier of its donor file ‚Äì *ultimately advancing the mission to support more individuals with disabilities*.
- **[Sentiment Analysis on Cloud](https://github.com/xiyi1201/Sentiment-Analysis-on-Cloud)**: This is a Cloud Engineering project which developed a sentiment analysis model using LSTM, SNN, and CNN on AWS to enhance efficiency and accuracy, deploying a real-time recommendation system via Streamlit.
- **[Bank Customer Segmentation and Attrition Analysis](https://github.com/xiyi1201/Bank-Customer-Segmentation-and-Attrition-Analysis)**: This is a Data Mining project which conducted customer segmentation and attrition prediction using PCA and K-Means, achieving high predictive accuracy with random forest and gradient boosting models. It also performed Recency, Frequency, Monetary analysis on spending behavior to extract further insights.  
- **[MovieLens Recommender System](https://github.com/xiyi1201/MovieLens-Recommender-System)**: This is a project about designing and building a movie recommendation engine using the [MovieLens](https://grouplens.org/datasets/movielens/100k/) dataset. I implemented collaborative filtering (user-based, item-based), matrix factorization techniques, and a hybrid recommender system. Furthermore, I optimized model performance through fine-tuning and evaluated using metrics while addressing cold start problems.
- **[Visual Question Answering and Object Detection](https://github.com/xiyi1201/Visual-Question-Answering-and-Object-Detection)**: This is a Deep Learning project which implemented YOLOv8 to visually highlight relevant objects, enhancing the understanding of items with a high mAP score.
- **[Airbnb Price Prediction with Supervised Models](https://github.com/xiyi1201/Airbnb-Price-Prediction-with-Supervised-Models)**: This is a Predictive Analytics project which predicted Airbnb prices (data from Kaggle) using multiple models, justifying price variations based on feature importance with a strong R¬≤ value.
